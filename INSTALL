Services for NeoStats 0.1 Release
=================================
Requirements:
Berkeley DB (Most systems have it already)
	- http://www.sleepycat.com/
NeoStats 2.0.12 (Duh)
	- http://www.neostats.net/neostats/

Tested with Unreal 3.1.1, 3.1.2 and 3.2Beta3

Depending on how u got Services for Neostats, depends on how to Install it.

If you got it part of Neostats, there isn't much apart from just enabling
services in the configure script:
	./configure --enable-services <any other options>
see ./configure --help for other options

if you got it as a Patch, then when I get around to doing it, I will write a
patch, but at the moment, you have to patch manually.

At the moment, if you can't figure out how to Patch stuff, then these
versions are not for you. As Development moves along, I will probably
release a script that patches Neo for you.
(as of Version 2.0.12 of Neo, there is a few bug fixes, but mostly feature
enhancements - Read the NeoStats Changelog after you patch)


Configuration:
==============
If you read the ReadMe file, then you will also realise that untill Operserv
is implemented, there is no easy way to configure Services. 
Currently, if you want to change something, then you have to edit
services.h. Towards the bottom of the file are #ifdef's 
Some are commented, some are not. 
if you are not sure what some of the #ifdef's do, then u should look in the
code.

If you want to reset the Databases, delete data/nsdata.db (for Nickserv)
