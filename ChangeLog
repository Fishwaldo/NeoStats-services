  strings as we speak... - Thanks to epona for the language stuff

Version 0.1.4A  - Fish - Ocotber 29, 2001

  if you forbid a nickname that is in use (and online) then it drops the
  registration as well (and notifies the online user that its dropped
- more bugfixes

- Nick Suspension done, with comment place in opercomment field

Version 0.1.2A  - Fish - October 27, 2001
- Drop nickname supported, with opers also able to drop nicknames!
  (Configurable levels again)
- opercomments added.. Allows opers to save comments with a nick
- sync db done... only sync's nicks that have changed information (good for
  large networks.. doesn't try to sync 2000 nicknames when only 100 have
  changed information that needs to be synced)
- set interface done
- Woop! its starting to be useable... 
- info and channel greetings sets
- AIM, ICQ, Password sets
- private, kill, secure set
- Added some checks to see how long timers and database sync's take.
  if it takes too long, it suggests the operators adjust timer settings via
  the services channel
- info updated
- logout - if a user wants to stay connected, but not identified to nickserv
  (because it might be a shared computer) they can un-identify (idea stolen
  from epona!)

Version 0.1.1A	- Fish - October 25, 2001
- Services Timers Implemented. Services Have their own Timer system that is
  independand of NeoStats
- Nick_change, Kill, Signoff
- Enforcer Nick signon and quit when a nick has not been identified for and
  if their kill setting is active
--- This needs investigation, Why Can't I sign on a user straight after
    sending svsnick? means I have to use a timer to sign them on, which is
    *bad*
- cleaned up some of the logging stuff.. made most other logging, apart from
  critical errors #ifdef DEBUG
- A few Bug Fixes.
- Has been running on a largish network for > 2Hrs
- /ctcp nickserv version just for fun!

Version 0.1Alpha - Fish - October 25th, 2001
- First release to Shmad
- Initial Nickserv services implemented... Very Basic Functions at the
  moment like:
	Register, Identify, Info, Ghost, Recover
- Uses Berkeley Database to store information. Very reliable. (I had so many
  crashes during my initial coding, and not once did the database be corrupt)	
- As far as I can tell, pretty stable... so far
